description: Understand refyne's latest changes and merges with upstream
agent: build

This is a fork of the project 'open-webui' called Refyne. It takes openwebui and creates its own changes in master branch while keeping another branch 'openweb' to keep changes from upstream aligned. I checkout to openweb, fetch upstream main, reset --hard to upstream/main, checkout master, and finally merge openweb.
Now answer and fix any question about broken merges, conflicts, comparing our changes with upstream's and combining both, etc.
