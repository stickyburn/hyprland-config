This is an isaaclab project for robotics. Its the specific branch feature/newton which does not require isaacsim to be installed, and uses newton as its primary backend for physics.
The project was not started with `isaaclab.sh --new` but custom created. 
More context in documentation here: https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/experimental-features/newton-physics-integration/installation.html
